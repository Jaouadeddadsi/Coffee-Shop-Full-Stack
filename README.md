# Coffee Shop Full Stack

This project is a part of Fullstack Nanodegree with [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). It is a coffee shop menu app where:

- Public users can view drink names and graphics.
- The shop baristas can see the recipe information.
- The shop managers can create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) gives the frontend of the project (View the [README.md](./frontend/README.md) within ./frontend for more details) and I built the backend use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) (View the [README.md](./backend/README.md) within ./backend for more details).

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
